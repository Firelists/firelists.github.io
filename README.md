Firelists
===========

## What is it?
A simple web app for creating and sharing check lists that synchronize in real time.

All checklists are public and available to anyone with the URL. This makes it easy to create and share the lists. Users can sign in using their Github/Twitter/Google account to save lists. The lists are still public, but you won't have to remember all the URLs.

## Is it finished?
It currently contains all the main features that I wanted. But I'd still like to add some things that I'm missing:
- Paste text and create a new item per line in the copied paragraph.
- Sorting (drag-and-drop to change display order)
- Responsive UI (for mobiles)

Ideas for new features are welcome!

## Why did you create it?
I haven't found a list app that I like lately. I used to use Google Keep when I had an Android phone, but since switching to an iPhone their is no longer an app for that. I tried Evernote but their support for checklists is terrible. 

So when I wanted to try [EmberJs](http://emberjs.org) I decided to create a web app for creating checklists. I had some experience with [Firebase](http://firebase.com) since before and thought it could work perfectly here, both for synchronizing the lists and for handling user authentication.

## Should I look at the source code?
Probably not. :) It is my first EmberJs project and the code is a mess and most likely there are a 100 better ways to do things. I hope to structure it and rewrite parts as I get better at Ember though, and I'd be happy to receive comments with ways to improve the code!
